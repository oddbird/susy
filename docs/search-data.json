Normalization","contents":"Syntax Normalization Susy is divided into two layers: “Su” provides the core math functions with a stripped-down syntax, while “Susy” adds global settings, shorthand syntax, and other helpers. Each setting (e.g. span, location, columns, spread, etc.) has a single canonical syntax in Su. This normalization module helps translate between those layers, transforming parsed Susy input into values that Su will understand. Related @function susy-normalize() @function susy-normalize-span() @function susy-normalize-columns() @function susy-normalize-spread() @function susy-normalize-location() @function susy-normalize() Normalize the values in a configuration map. In addition to the global $susy properties, this map can include local span-related information, like span and location. Normalization does not check that values are valid, which will happen in the Su math layer. These functions merely look for known Susy syntax – returning a map with those shorthand values converted into low-level data for Su. For example span: all and location: first will be converted into specific numbers. Parameters & Return $config: (map) Map of Susy configuration settings to normalize. See $susy and susy-parse() documentation for details. $context: null (map | null) Map of Susy configuration settings to use as global reference, or null to use global settings. @return (map) Map of Susy configuration settings, with all values normalized for Su math functions.

Su span syntax allows an explicit length (e.g. 3em), unitless column-span number (e.g. 3 columns), or an explicit list of columns (e.g. (3 5 8)). Susy span syntax also allows the all keyword, which will be converted to a slice of the context in normalization. Parameters & Return $span: (number | list | 'all') Span value to normalize. $columns: (list) Normalized list of columns in the grid @return (number | list) Number or list value for $span Used By @function susy-normalize() @function susy-normalize-columns() Normalize column shorthand for Su. Su column syntax only allows column lists (e.g. 120px 1 1 1 120px). Susy span syntax also allows a unitless slice number (e.g of 5), which will be converted to a slice of the context in normalization. Parameters & Return $columns: (list | integer) List of available columns, or unitless integer representing a slice of the available context. $context: null (map | null) Map of Susy configuration settings to use as global reference, or null to access global settings. @return (list) Columns list value, normalized for Su input. @error when attempting to access a slice of asymmetrical context Requires @function susy-settings() @function _susy-flatten() [private] @function susy-repeat() @function _susy-error() [private] Used By @function susy-normalize() @function susy-normalize-spread() Normalize spread shorthand for Su. Su spread syntax only allows the numbers -1, 0, or 1 – representing the number of gutters covered in relation to columns spanned. Susy spread syntax also allows keywords for each value – narrow for -1, wide for 0, or wider for 1 – which will be converted to their respective integers in normalization. Parameters & Return $spread: (0 | 1 | -1 | 'narrow' | 'wide' | 'wider') Spread across adjacent gutters, relative to a column-count — either narrow (-1), wide (0), or wider (1) @return (number) Numeric value for $spread Used By @function susy-normalize() @function susy-normalize-location() Normalize location shorthand for Su. Su location syntax requires the (1-indexed) number for a column. Susy also allows the first and last keywords, where first is always 1, and last is calculated based on span and column values. Both keywords are normalized into an integer index in normalization. Parameters & Return $span: (number) Number of grid-columns to be spanned $location: (integer | 'first' | 'last') Starting (1-indexed) column position of a span, or a named location keyword. $columns: (list) Already-normalized list of columns in the grid. @return (integer) Numeric value for $location Used By @function susy-normalize()"},"_parser.html":{"filename":"_parser.html","title":"Susy Syntax Parser","contents":"Shorthand Syntax Parser The syntax parser converts shorthand syntax into a map of settings that can be compared/merged with other config maps and global setting. @function susy-parse() The parse function provides all the syntax-sugar in Susy, converting user shorthand into a usable map of keys and values that can be normalized and passed to Su.

Use span() and gutter() to return any grid-width, and apply the results wherever you need them: CSS width, margin, padding, flex-basis, transform, etc. For asymmetrical-fluid grids, slice() can help manage your nesting context. All three functions come with an unprefixed alias by default, using the susy import. Import the susy-prefix partial instead, if you only only want prefixed versions of the API. This is a thin syntax-sugar shell around the “Su” core-math functions: su-span, su-gutter, and su-slice. If you prefer the more constrained syntax of the math engine, you are welcome to use those functions instead. Related @function susy-span() @function susy-gutter() @function susy-slice() @function su-span() @function su-gutter() @function su-slice() Shorthand All functions draw on the same shorthand syntax in two parts, seperated by the word of. Span Syntax: <width> [<location> <spread>] The first part describes the span width, location, and spread in any order. Only the width is required: span(2) will return the width of 2 columns. span(3 wide) will return 3-columns, with an additional gutter. location is only needed with asymmetrical grids, where span(3 at 2) will return the width of specific columns on the grid. Since these are functions, they will not handle placement for you. Context Syntax: [of <columns> <container-spread> <gutters>] The second half of Susy’s shorthand describes the grid-context – available columns, container-spread, and optional gutter override – in any order. All of these settings have globally-defined defaults: span(2 of 6) will set the context to a slice of 6 columns from the global grid. More details below. span(2 of 12 wide) changes the container-spread as well as the column-context. span(2 of 12 set-gutters 0.5em) will override the global gutters setting for this one calculation. A single unitless number for columns will be treated as a slice of the parent grid. On a grid with columns: susy-repeat(12, 120px), the shorthand of 4 will use the parent 120px column-width. You can also be more explicit, and say of susy-repeat(4, 100px). If you are using asymmetrical grids, like columns: (1 1 2 3 5 8), Susy can’t slice it for you without knowing which columns you want. The slice function accepts exactly the same syntax as span, but returns a list of columns rather than a width. Use it in your context like of slice(first 3). @function susy-span() aliased as span() This is the primary function in Susy — used to return the width of a span across one or more columns, and any relevant gutters along the way. With the default settings, span(3) will return the width of 3 columns, and the 2 intermediate gutters. This can be used to set the width property of grid elements, or margin and padding to push, pull, and pad your elements. This is a thin syntax-sugar shell around the core-math su-span() function. The un-prefixed alias span() is available by default. Parameters & Return $span: (list) Shorthand expression to define the width of the span, optionally containing: a count, length, or column-list span. at $n, first, or last location on asymmetrical grids, where at 1 == first, and last will calculate the proper location based on columns and span. narrow, wide, or wider for optionally spreading across adjacent gutters. of $n <spread> for available grid columns and spread of the container. Span counts like of 6 are valid in the context of symmetrical grids, where Susy can safely infer a slice of the parent columns. and set-gutters $n to override global gutter settings. $config: () (map) Optional map of Susy grid configuration settings. See $susy documentation for details. @return (length) Calculated length value, using the units given, or converting to % for fraction-based grids, or a full calc function when units/fractions are not comparable outside the browser. Examples scss span half the grid .foo { // the result is a bit under 50% to account for gutters width: susy-span(6 of 12); } css compiled .foo { width: 49.15254%; } scss span a specific segment of asymmetrical grid .foo { width: susy-span(3 at 3 of (1 2 3 5 8)); } css compiled .foo { width: 82.5%; } Related @function su-span() $susy Requires @function susy-compile() @function su-call() @function _susy-error() [private] Used By @function span() @function susy-svg-grid() @function _susy-svg-column-position() [private] @function susy-gutter() aliased as gutter() The gutter function returns the width of a single gutter on your grid, to be applied where you see fit – on margins, padding, transform, or element width. This is a thin syntax-sugar shell around the core-math su-gutter() function. The un-prefixed alias gutter() is available by default. Parameters & Return $context: null (list | number) Optional context for nested gutters, including shorthand for columns, gutters, and container-spread (additional shorthand will be ignored) $config: () (map) Optional map of Susy grid configuration settings. See $susy documentation for details. @return (length) Width of a gutter as % of current context, or in the units defined by column-width when available Examples scss add gutters before or after an element .floats { float: left; width: span(3 of 6); margin-left: gutter(of 6); } css compiled .floats { float: left; width: 48.27586%; margin-left: 3.44828%; } scss add gutters to padding .flexbox { flex: 1 1 span(3 wide of 6 wide); padding: gutter(of 6) / 2; } css compiled .flexbox { flex: 1 1 50%; padding: 1.72414%; } Related @function su-gutter() $susy Requires @function susy-compile() @function su-call() Used By @function gutter() @function susy-slice() aliased as slice() Working with asymmetrical grids (un-equal column widths) can be challenging – expecially when they involve fluid/fractional elements. Describing a context of (15em 6em 6em 6em 15em) is a lot to put inside the span or gutter function shorthand. This slice function returns a sub-slice of asymmetrical columns to use for a nested context. slice(3 at 2) will give you a subset of the global grid, spanning 3 columns, starting with the second. This is a thin syntax-sugar shell around the core-math su-slice() function. The un-prefixed alias slice() is available by default. Parameters & Return $span: (list) Shorthand expression to define the subset span, optionally containing: at $n, first, or last location on asymmetrical grids; of $n <spread> for available grid columns and spread of the container Span-counts like of 6 are only valid in the context of symmetrical grids Valid spreads include narrow, wide, or wider $config: () (map) Optional map of Susy grid configuration settings. See $susy documentation for details. @return (list) Subset list of columns for use for a nested context Example scss Return a nested segment of asymmetrical grid $context: susy-slice(3 at 3 of (1 2 3 5 8)); /* $context: #{$context}; */ css compiled /* $context: 3 5 8; */ Related @function su-slice() $susy Requires @function susy-compile() @function su-call() Used By @function slice() Building Grids The web has come a long way since the days of double-margin-hacks and inconsistent subpixel rounding. In addition to floats and tables, we can now use much more powerful tools, like flexbox and CSS grid, to build more interesting and responsive layouts. With Susy3, we hope you’ll start moving in that direction. You can still build classic 12-column Grid Systems, and we’ll help you get there, but Susy3 is primarily designed for a grid-math-on-demand approach to layout: applying our functions only where you really need grid math. Read the intro article by OddBird for more details.

Site moved to oddbird.net/susy/ Docs moved to oddbird.net/susy/docs/ BREAKING: No More Mixins! span, container, gutters, last, gallery, etc. have all been removed from Susy. Web layout has become too powerful & flexible to contain in a simple set of shortcuts. BREAKING: Remove rubygems/bower, to distribute on npm only. BREAKING: Trim down to the core math, and a thin layer of api functions: susy-span() (aliased as span) to return a column-spanning width. susy-gutter() (aliased as gutter) to return a gutter width. susy-slice() (aliased as slice) to return a slice of asymmetrical grid.

BREAKING: Add support for calc() output, so mixed-unit grids are possible. This means the old inside-static solution has been replaced by calc() output as well. BREAKING: Shorthand syntax for on-the-fly span and settings. This is similar to the previous shorthand, but has been simplified to remove mixin-related features. starting with a count, length, or column-list “span” at $n, first, or last location on asymmetrical grids narrow, wide, or wider for spread of $n <spread> for available grid columns and container-spread set-gutters $n shorthand to override global gutter settings NEW: susy-repeat() function to generate repeating gradients with the same syntax provided in CSS Grid templates NEW: SVG Grid plugin (susy/plugins/svg-grid), to provide grid-debugging options when applied as a background image to any container element: svg-grid-colors global setting accepts one or more colors susy-svg-grid() function returns inline svg for use in the background or generated content properties NEW: susy-compile() and su-call() plugin helpers, to aide with conversions between the user API and internal math functions. This is primarily useful for anyone building Susy extensions or mixins. NEW: prefixed and unprefixed versions of all major API functions. Import susy-prefix instead of susy to eliminate the un-prefixed alias versions. 3.0.0-beta.1 - June 19, 2017 BREAKING: _prefix.scss has been renamed _susy-prefix.scss for clarity when importing. BREAKING: susy-call() has been renamed su-call(). since it is directly related to accessing the su functions. BREAKING: Remove support for non-list columns: 'columns': 4 => 'columns': susy-repeat(4) == 'columns': 1 1 1 1. BREAKING: Remove support for $count x $width syntax in columns: 'columns': 4 x 120px => 'columns': susy-repeat(4, 120px) == 'columns': 120px 120px 120px 120px.

Add global $susy-media map for creating named breakpoints. Add internal media-query support for susy-breakpoint without requiring the Breakpoint plugin. susy-breakpoint mixin no longer requires $layout argument. By default, no changes will be made to your existing layout. Update global-box-sizing and the legacy border-box-sizing mixins to optionally take another argument, $inherit. This new argument is a boolean value that defaults to false, meaning the behavior of these mixins will not change by default. The default behavior sets all elements to use the specified box-sizing, which can only be changed explicitly on a per-element basis. By passing in $inherit as true, the box-sizing is set on the html element, and all other elements inherit this property. This means that the box-sizing can be changed at the component level and all nested elements will inherit this change. This cascading effect can be prevented by explicitly setting box-sizing on the exceptions within the nested context. Add su import at root level. Both su and susy work with the latest LibSass master branch (3.0.2+). There are a few exceptions: The susysone syntax overlay grid output The inherit option for global-box-sizing & border-box-sizing 2.1.3 - Jul 16 2014 Baseline grid image uses px instead of %. Updated Sass dependency to work with 3.4. 2.1.2 - Apr 28 2014 first and last keywords output 0 margins instead of null so they can be used to override previous span settings. Output :before / :after rather than ::before / ::after to support IE8. Load Susy paths in Compass if required, otherwise add it to SASS_PATH. [Adrien Antoine <https://github.com/Alshten>_] Compass 1.0 config no longer needs to require 'susy'. Susy is registered with Compass automatically. Add $clean argument to layout and with-layout mixins, for creating new layout contexts from a clean slate. 2.1.1 - Mar 13 2014 Rename core math functions, and prepare for decomposition. column-count() => susy-count() column-sum() => susy-sum() column-span() => susy-slice() column-span-sum() => susy() Add tests for core math validation. 2.0.0 — Mar 10 2014 New susyone tests for split-columns, is-default-layout, medialayout, columns, relative-width, columns width and nth-of-type (using True). Sass 3.3.0 (Maptastic Maple) Rename local 2.0 variables that conflict with global susyone settings. Susyone container mixin applies full container settings at every breakpoint. 2.0.0.rc.2 — Mar 4 2014 Fix templates_path and compass project templates Fix Compass “rem” integration to respect $rhythm-units setting. 2.0.0.rc.1 — Feb 7 2014 Add browser support module with settings to use-custom mixins for background-image, background-options (-size, -clip, -origin), box-sizing, clearfix, and rem. If you set to false, we’ll make sure everything works well on modern browsers. If you set to true, we’ll check for existing mixins (e.g. from Compass or Bourbon) to provide more powerful legacy support. … code-block: scss $susy: ( use-custom: ( clearfix: false, background-image: true, background-options: false, box-sizing: true, rem: true, ), ); Fix bugs caused by Sass changes to str-index(), #{&}, and @at-root. Fix Bower dependencies, and add support for Sache. Remove legacy Compass polyfils from susyone code. 2.0.0.beta.3 — Jan 10 2014 Fix a bug making show-grid unaware of local debug/output keywords. Added Susyone syntax for those that need to use the old Susy syntax, with updated Sass and Compass. @import 'susyone'; 2.0.0.beta.2 — Jan 6 2014 Allow nesting of Susy settings. show-grid mixin can output either background or overlay grids. Add isolate function to return isolation offset width. Fix a bug with last output for split-gutter layouts. Fix a bug with split-gutter span(), and narrow/wider keywords. Fix a bug with bleed and null + inside gutters. bleed output uses TRBL shorthand when possible. Clean up and document the core math functions. Document upgrade path, core-math, and DIY grids. BREAKING: Move debug settings into $susy: (debug: (<settings>));. Replace show-grid setting with new debug: image setting. Add debug: output setting and keywords to toggle between background and overlay grid images. Remove grid-overlay mixin. Becomes part of show-grid mixin. Doesn’t take $selector argument — should be nested instead. Can still be used multiple times. isolate mixin now interprets span argument as location, unless location is otherwise specified. isolate(2) is the same as isolate(at 2). isolate(25%) will isolate at 25%. Rename setting controls for consistency. set-grid => layout use-grid => with-layout pad and squish use RL shorthand for shared context. pad(1, 3 of 12) => pad(1 3 of 12) 2.0.0.beta.1 — Dec 24 2013 Add susy-breakpoint mixin for basic integration with Breakpoint Syntax: breakpoint($query, $layout, $no-query) where $query and no-query follow the Breakpoint syntax, and $layout uses the Susy syntax for defining grids. Add layout function to convert layouts from shorthand syntax to map. Add full keyword shortcut for full-width spans. BREAKING: Remove unclear row and unrow mixins. Add break and nobreak mixins/keywords to create a new line before any element in the layout. BREAKING: Rename is-container: container setting/value to role: nest. BREAKING: Rename layout-method setting to output. BREAKING: Rename layout-math setting to math. Clean up division between math/output/syntax layers. gutters and container-position can be set to null. If gutters are set to 0 or null, they will have no output. BREAKING: full output matches span patterns. BREAKING: Debug grids are hidden by default. BREAKING: Remove nth-last/-omega/-first/-alpha as confusing & out-of-scope. Format your nth-selectors manually to apply first/last mixins. Gutter mixins/functions can accept context-only (without the “of” syntax): gutters(of 10 .25) == gutters(10 .25) Unitless numbers are used for context. Lengths (with units) are used as explicit gutter-overrides. BREAKING: Re-purposed susy-set as reverse of susy-get — to adjust a single setting. Example: @include susy-set(gutter-position, inside); Replace global box-sizing setting with global-box-sizing. Let Susy know what box model you are using globally. box-sizing can still be passed as a keyword argument. Add global-box-sizing() mixin to set your global box model. Example: @include global-box-sizing(border-box); You can still use the legacy @include border-box-sizing; as a shortcut. Uses your global setting as a default. Updates your global setting to match, if you pass a different value. gallery and span mixins take global-box-sizing into account. 2.0.0-alpha.6 — Dec 5 2013 Rewrite syntax parsing so parser and resulting maps are shared across Susy. Fix explicit-span bug causing large gutters. Padding mixins now respect inside gutters. Backwards Incompatible: Removed gutters $n keyword in shorthand syntax for setting explicit gutters. Use (gutter-override: $n) map instead. 2.0.0-alpha.5 — Nov 25 2013 Compass is no longer a dependency. Only registers as a compass extension if compass is present. Any mixin/function that accepts natural language syntax also accepts maps. Maps and natural language can be mixed: $large: (columns: 12, gutters: .5); span(3 $large no-gutters) Add full mixin for full-width spans. Backwards Incompatible: Requires Sass 3.3 Default settings are handled with a Sass map on the $susy variable. Example: $susy: (columns: 12, gutters: .25) etc. bleed now takes standard span syntax, with multiple (TRBL) spans. e.g. bleed(1em 2 of 8) for 1em top/bottom and 2-columns left/right. Add bleed-x/bleed-y mixins for horizontal and vertical shortcuts. Span arguments now accept narrow, wide, or wider keywords. The wide keyword replaces the old outer keyword. This setting has been re-named from outer to spread. Re-wrote grid debugging More concise & accurate output for symmetrical grids. Changed grid-background() to show-grid()/show-grids() Changed overlay-grid() to grid-overlay() Moved settings into $debug: (color: rgba(#66f, .25), toggle: top right); Removed overlay-position setting. Only display vertical-rhythms when $base-line-height is available. split gutters are no longer removed at the grid edges. first and last are not special cases for split gutter-handling. pass the container argument to wrappers you plan to nest inside. first/alpha/last/omega/nth- mixins require grid context. 2.0.0-alpha.4 — Sept 4 2013 Add bleed mixin. Fix bug with fluid inside-gutter calculations. $last-flow setting controls the flow direction of row-ending elements. background-grid-output now accepts $line-height argument. Compass modules are imported as needed. grid-background, grid-overlay, grid-background-output, & $grid-background-color have been renamed to remiain consistent and avoid conflicts with Compass: grid-background => background-grid grid-overlay => overlay-grid grid-background-output => background-grid-output $grid-background-color => $grid-color span mixing accepts nested @content, and uses nested context. Add inside-static option for static gutters in otherwise fluid grids. gutters mixin uses span syntax, accepts explicit gutter span. Explicit gutter-overrides are divided when gutters are split/inside. 2.0.0-alpha.3 — July 9 2013 row now includes clearfix, and unrow removes clearfix. gallery output should override previous gallery settings. Removed nth-gallery and isolate-gallery in favor of single, isolated gallery mixin. Add padding-span syntax: prefix, suffix, and pad. Add margin-span syntax: pre, post, push, pull, and squish. New gutters mixin adds gutters to an element. gutter function now returns half-widths when using split/inside gutters. Add outer keyword to span syntax, to return span-width including gutters. Works with both span mixin and span function. Replaces Susy 1.0 space function. Add comrehensive unit tests, using True. Improve fall-abck handling of ommitted arguments. Add container function to return a given container’s width. Add auto keyword to override $container-width, otherwise respect existing width. Renamed $isolate to $layout-method No longer accepts boolean. Accepts keywords isolate and (default) float. Renamed $static to $layout-math No longer accepts boolean. Accepts keywords static (use given units) and (default) fluid (use % units). Add show-columns and show-baseline keywords to $show-grids setting. show will show both columns/baseline, default is show-columns. 2.0.0-alpha.2 — May 7 2013 Added gutter <length>/gutters <length> to override the attached gutter width on a single span. NOTE: gutters 0 is not the same as no-gutters. 0 is an output value, no-gutters removes output. Added container span option to remove inside gutters from nesting containers. Added before/after/split/inside/no-gutters gutter options. Added gallery mixin for auto-generating gallery layouts. Moved grid-backgrounds into language layer, and made them syntax-aware. Added row/unrow, first/last, alpha/omega, nth-first/nth-last, and nth-alpha/nth-omega. Added container and span mixins with new syntax. Added syntax-aware math functions (span/gutter/outer-span). Added rough translate-susy1-settings mixin. Moved syntax-specific math into language layer. Fleshed-out new language syntax. Added get-grid, set-grid, and use-grid and declaring and managing settings. Remove breakpoint core requirement (will come back as option) 2.0.0-alpha.1 — Jan 26 2013 Susy 2.0 was re-written from the ground up. Functioning math engine Initial string parsing for natural syntax Float/Isolation output methods Removed all ECHOE/RAKE stuff in favor of vanilla .gemspec Added Ruby based String Split function Added Sass based grid-add function, to add grids à la Singularity Added default variables 1.0.5 — Nov 27 2012 Add support for rem-units. Clean-up quoted arguments. Fix a few bugs related to the override settings. 1.0.4 — Nov 3 2012 Fix bug in nested mixins that adjust support (e.g. nth-omeg inside at-breakpoint). Remove non-ie experimental support in at-breakpoint ie-fallback output. 1.0.3 — Oct 20 2012 Fix Compass dependencies. 1.0.2 — Oct 20 2012 Fix a bug with container-outer-width ignoring $columns argument. Turn off legacy-ie support inside CSS3 selectors (nth-omega etc). 1.0.1 — Sept 12 2012 Fix a bug in the relationship between $container-width and $border-box-sizing, so that grid-padding is subtracted from the width in certain cases. Reset right margin to auto rather than 0 with remove-omega. 1.0 — Aug 14 2012 This release is loaded with new features, but don’t let that fool you. Susy just became shockingly simple to use. The gem name has changed from compass-susy-plugin to susy. First uninstall the old gem, then install the new one. If you have both gems installed, you will get errors. Semantics: We re-arranged the code in order to make the syntax simpler and more consistent: $total-cols is now $total-columns. $col-width is now $column-width. $side-gutter-width is now $grid-padding and gets applied directly to the grid container. un-column & reset-column mixins have merged into reset-columns. columns has been renamed span-columns to resolve the conflict with CSS3 columns. See other improvements to span-columns below. We also removed several bothersome requirements: The alpha mixin is no longer needed. Ever. The omega no longer takes a $context argument. full has been removed entirely. Elements will be full-width by default. You can add clear: both; back in as needed. side-gutter() is no longer needed. You can use the $grid-padding setting directly. Upgrade: That’s all you need in order to upgrade from Susy 0.9. Uninstall and re-install the gem. Find and replace the semantic changes listed above. You’re done! Stop worrying about all that “nested vs. root” bullshit, and start playing with the new toys! If you use the $from directional arguments directly in the span-columns mixin, there may be one more change to make. See below: New Features: span-columns supports new features: “omega” can be applied directly through the $columns argument. Internal padding can be added through the $padding argument. This pushes the $from argument from third position into fourth. at-breakpoint allows you to change layouts at media breakpoints. container accepts multiple media-layout combinations as a shortcut. layout allows you to use a different layout at any time. with-grid-settings allows you to change any or all grid settings. set-container-width does what it says, without the other container code. $breakpoint-media-output, $breakpoint-ie-output, and $breakpoint-raw-output settings help manage the different outputs from at-breakpoint when you have IE-overrides living in a file of their own. border-box-sizing will apply the popular * { box-sizing: border-box } universal box-model fix, as well as changing the Susy $border-box-model setting for you, so Susy knows to adjust some math. The space() function can be used anywhere you need column+gutter math. push/pull/pre/post/squish mixins help manage margins. use the nth-omega mixin to set omega on any nth-child, nth-of-type, first, last, or only element. remove-omega and remove-nth-omega will remove the omega-specific styles from an element. $container-width will override the width of your container with any arbitrary length. $container-style will override the type of grid container (magic, fluid, fixed, static, etc) to use. 0.9 — Apr 25 2011 Everything here is about simplicity. Susy has scaled back to it’s most basic function: providing flexible grids. That is all. Deprecated: The susy/susy import is deprecated in favor of simply importing susy. The show-grid import is deprecated in favor of CSS3 gradient-based grid-images. You can now use the susy-grid-background mixin. See below. Removed: Susy no longer imports all of compass. Susy no longer establishes your baseline and no longer provides a reset. All of that is in the Compass core. You can (and should!) keep using them, but you will need to import them from compass. New: Use susy-grid-background mixin on any container to display the grid. This toggles on and off with the same controls that are used by the compass grid-background module. 0.9.beta.3 — Mar 16 2011 Deprecated: The susy/reset import has been deprecated in favor of the Compass core compass/reset import. The susy mixin has been deprecated. If you plan to continue using vertical-rhythms, you should replace it with the establish-baseline mixin from the Compass Core. Removed: The vertical-rhythm module has moved into compass core. The API remains the same, but if you were importing it directly, you will have to update that import. ($px2em was removed as part of this, but didn’t make it into core). The defaults template has been removed as ‘out-of-scope’. This will not effect upgrading in any way, but new projects will not get a template with default styles. New Features: Susy now supports RTL grids and bi-directional sites using the $from-direction variable (default: left) and an optional additional from-direction argument on all affected mixins. Thanks to @bangpound for the initial implementation. Susy is now written in pure Sass! No extra Ruby functions included! Thanks to the Sass team for making it possible. 0.8.1 — Sep 24 2010 Fixed typos in tutorial and _defaults.scss 0.8.0 — Aug 13 2010 Deprecated: The skip-link was deprecated as it doesn’t belong in Susy. All the IE-specific mixins have been deprecated, along with the $hacks variable. Hacks are now used in the default mixins as per Compass. The hide mixin was deprecated in favor of the Compass hide-text mixin. Other Changes: inline-block-list will be moved to the compass core soon. In preparation, I’ve cleaned it up some. You can now apply a padding of “0” to override previous padding arguments. You can also use inline-block-list-container and inline-block-list-item as you would with the Compass horizontal-list mixins. The $align arguments have been removed from both the susy and container mixins. Text-alignment is no longer used or needed in achieving page centering. That was a cary-over from the IE5 Mac days. The container mixin now uses the pie-clearfix compass mixin to avoid setting the overflow to hidden. Default styles have been cleaned up to account for better font stacks and typography, html5 elements, vertically-rhythmed forms, expanded print styles, use of @extend, and overall simplification. 0.7.0 — Jun 01 2010 updated documentation 0.7.0.rc2 — May 13 2010 Fixes a bug with grid.png and a typo in the readme. Nothing major here. 0.7.0.rc1 — May 12 2010 template cleanup & simplification - no more pushing CSSEdit comments, etc. expanded base and defaults with better fonts & styles out-of-the-box expanded readme documentation. This will expand out into a larger docs/tutorial site in the next week. 0.7.0.pre8 — Apr 20 2010 mostly syntax and gem cleanup added un-column mixin to reset elements previously declared as columns. added rhythm mixin as shortcut for leaders/trailers. accepts 4 args: leader, padding-leader, padding-trailer, trailer. added a warning on alpha to remind you that alpha is not needed at nested levels. 0.7.0.pre7 — Apr 13 2010 Requires HAML 3 and Compass 0.10.0.rc2 Internal syntax switched to scss. This will have little or no effect on users. You can still use Susy with either (Sass/Scss) syntax. $default-rhythm-border-style overrides default rhythm border styles Better handling of sub-pixel rounding for IE6 0.7.0.pre6 — Mar 29 2010 Added +h-borders() shortcut for vertical_rhythm +horizontal-borders() Fixed vertical rhythm font-size typo (thanks @oscarduignan) Added to template styles, so susy is already in place from the start 0.7.0.pre5 — Mar 19 2010 Expanded and adjusted _vertical_rhythm.sass in ways that are not entirely backwards compatible. Check the file for details. _defaults.sass is re-ordered from inline to block. :focus defaults cleaned up. README and docs updated. 0.7.0.pre4 — Jan 20 2010 Update: pre2 was missing a file in the manifest. Use pre4. Update: Forgot to note one change: +susy is no longer assigned to the body tag, but instead at the top level of the document (not nested under anything). Warning: This update is not backwards compatible. We’ve changed some things. You’ll have to change some things. Our changes were fairly major in cleaning up the code - yours will be minor and also clean up some code. Added: new _vertical_rhythm.sass (thanks to Chris Eppstein) provides better establishing of the baseline grid, as well as mixins to help you manage it. !px2em has replaced px2em() - see below. Removed: px2em() has been removed and replaced with a simple variable !px2em which returns the size of one pixel relative to your basic em-height. Multiply against your desired px dimensions (i.e. border-width = !px2em*5px will output the em-equivalent of 5px). !base_font_size_px and !base_line_height_px have been replaced with !base_font_size and !base_line_height which take advantage of sass’s built-in unit handling. !grid_units is not needed, as you can now declare your units directly in the other grid _width variables. Use any one type of units in declaring your grid. The units you use will be used in setting the container size. Once you’ve upgraded, before you compile your files, make these changes: remove the “_px” from the font-size and line-height variables, and add “px” to their values. remove the !grid_units variable and add units to your grid variable values. find any uses of px2em() and replace them with something. enjoy! 0.7.0.pre1 — Nov 30 2009 Not a lot of new functionality here – it all moved over to Compass 0.10.0 – mostly just cleaning it up to match. simplified the default styles and gave them their own project template (_defaults.sass). defaults not imported by ie.sass, as ie.sass should be cascading on top of screen.sass anyway changed the syntax to match CSS and Compass (property: replaces :property) added more inline documentation and brought tutorial up to date moved CSS3 module over to Compass import the compass HTML5 reset along with the normal reset by default (because Susy loves the future) little internal management fixes and so on and so on… Older Not documented here. Check the commit log…"},"config.html":{"filename":"config.html","title":"Grid Configuration","contents":"Susy3 Configuration Susy3 has 4 core settings, in a single settings map. You’ll notice a few differences from Susy2: Columns no longer accept a single number, like 12, but use a syntax more similar to the new CSS grid-template-columns – a list of relative sizes for each column on the grid. Unitless numbers in Susy act very similar to fr units in CSS, and the susy-repeat() function (similar to the css repeat()) helps quickly establish equal-width columns. susy-repeat(12) will create 12 fluid, equal-width columns susy-repeat(6, 120px) will create 6 equal 120px-wide columns 120px susy-repeat(4) 120px will create 6 columns, the first and last are 120px, while the middle 4 are equal fractions of the remainder. Susy will output calc() values in order to achieve this. Gutters haven’t changed – a single fraction or explicit width – but the calc() output feature means you can now use any combination of units and fractions to create static-gutters on a fluid grid, etc. Spread existed in the Susy2 API as a span option, and was otherwise handled behind the scenes. Now we’re giving you full control over all spread issues. You can find a more detailed explanation of spread on the blog. You can access your global settings at any time with the susy-settings() function, or grab a single setting from the global scope with susy-get('columns'), susy-get('gutters') etc. Related Article: Understanding Spread in Susy3 [external] $susy @function susy-settings() @function susy-get() $susy (Map) scss $susy: () !default; The grid is defined in a single map variable, with four initial properties: columns, gutters, spread and container-spread. Anything you put in the root $susy variable map will be treated as a global project default. You can create similar configuration maps under different variable names, to override the defaults as-needed. Since 3.0.0-beta.1: columns setting no longer accepts numbers (e.g. 12) for symmetrical fluid grids, or the initial 12 x 120px syntax for symmetrical fixed-unit grids. Use susy-repeat(12) or susy-repeat(12, 120px) instead. Map Properties columns: (list) Columns are described by a list of numbers, representing the relative width of each column. The syntax is a simplified version of CSS native grid-template-columns, expecting a list of grid-column widths. Unitless numbers create fractional fluid columns (similar to the CSS-native fr unit), while length values (united numbers) are used to define static columns. You can mix-and match units and fractions, to create a mixed grid. Susy will generate calc() values when necessary, to make all your units work together. Use the susy-repeat($count, $value) function to more easily repetative columns, similar to the CSS-native repeat(). susy-repeat(8): an 8-column, symmetrical, fluid grid. Identical to (1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1). susy-repeat(6, 8em): a 6-column, symmetrical, em-based grid. Identical to (8em 8em 8em 8em 8em 8em). (300px susy-repeat(4) 300px): a 6-column, asymmetrical, mixed fluid/static grid using calc() output. Identical to (300px 1 1 1 1 300px). NOTE that 12 is no longer a valid 12-column grid definition, and you must list all the columns individually (or by using the susy-repeat() function). gutters: (number) Gutters are defined as a single width, or fluid ratio, similar to the native-CSS grid-column-gap syntax. Similar to columns, gutters can use any valid CSS length unit, or unitless numbers to define a relative fraction. 0.5: a fluid gutter, half the size of a single-fraction column. 1em: a static gutter, 1em wide. Mix static gutters with fluid columns, or vice versa, and Susy will generate the required calc() to make it work. spread: narrow (string) Spread of an element across adjacent gutters: either narrow (none), wide (one), or wider (two) Both spread settings default to narrow, the most common use-case. A narrow spread only has gutters between columns (one less gutter than columns). This is how all css-native grids work, and most margin-based grid systems. A wide spread includes the same number of gutters as columns, spanning across a single side-gutter. This is how most padding-based grid systems often work, and is also useful for pushing and pulling elements into place. The rare wider spread includes gutters on both sides of the column-span (one more gutters than columns). container-spread: narrow (string) Spread of a container around adjacent gutters: either narrow (none), wide (one), or wider (two). See spread property for details. Examples scss default values // 4 symmetrical, fluid columns // gutters are 1/4 the size of a column // elements span 1 less gutter than columns // containers span 1 less gutter as well $susy: ( 'columns': susy-repeat(4), 'gutters': 0.25, 'spread': 'narrow', 'container-spread': 'narrow', ); scss inside-static gutters // 6 symmetrical, fluid columns… // gutters are static, triggering calc()… // elements span equal columns & gutters… // containers span equal columns & gutters… $susy: ( 'columns': susy-repeat(6), 'gutters': 0.5em, 'spread': 'wide', 'container-spread': 'wide', ); Related Spread examples on CodePen [external] $_susy-defaults [private] @function susy-repeat() Used By @function susy-settings() @function susy-repeat() Similar to the repeat(<count>, <value>) function that is available in native CSS Grid templates, the susy-repeat() function helps generate repetative layouts by repeating any value a given number of times. Where Susy previously allowed 8 as a column definition for 8 equal columns, you should now use susy-repeat(8). Parameters & Return $count: (integer) The number of repetitions, e.g. 12 for a 12-column grid. $value: 1 (*) The value to be repeated. Technically any value can be repeated here, but the function exists to repeat column-width descriptions: e.g. the default 1 for single-fraction fluid columns, 5em for a static column, or even 5em 120px if you are alternating column widths. @return (list) List of repeated values Examples scss // 12 column grid, with 5em columns $susy: ( columns: susy-repeat(12, 5em), ); scss // asymmetrical 5-column grid $susy: ( columns: 20px susy-repeat(3, 100px) 20px, ); /* result: #{susy-get('columns')} */ css compiled /* result: 20px 100px 100px 100px 20px */ Used By @function susy-normalize-columns() @function susy-settings() Return a combined map of Susy settings, based on the factory defaults ($_susy-defaults), user-defined project configuration ($susy), and any local overrides required – such as a configuration map passed into a function.

It should no longer be used on new projects, and will no longer be receiving any updates. Susy is a design-agnostic set of tools for creating powerful, custom layouts. We didn’t want another grid system full of rules and restrictions — we wanted a power tool for building our own damn systems.

The default sass/susy comes with un-prefixed versions of the core API functions. If you want Susy to be name-spaced, import sass/susy-prefix instead. // un-prefixed functions @import '<path-to>/susy/sass/susy'; // susy-prefixed functions @import '<path-to>/susy/sass/susy-prefix'; Using Eyeglass With eyeglass set up, you can @import 'susy'; without providing the npm-modules path. Using Webpack Make sure sass-loader is installed: npm install sass-loader --save-dev Make sure you have sass-loader enabled in your webpack configuration: // webpack.config.js module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.scss$/, use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader'] } ] } Start using Susy: /* app.scss */ @import \"~susy/sass/susy\"; Using Gulp Add a gulp task: // gulpfile.js gulp.task('sass', function() { return gulp.src('scss/*.scss') .pipe(sass({ outputStyle: 'compressed', includePaths: ['node_modules/susy/sass'] }).on('error', sass.logError)) .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/css')); }); Start using Susy: /* app.scss */ @import 'susy'; Using Grunt (and Yeoman) To add Susy to the Sass task, edit your Gruntfile.js at the root level of your project and look for the Sass-related rules.

Start using Susy: /* app.scss */ @import 'susy'; Susy vs Su You may notice that some functions have a susy- prefix, while others only have su-. This helps distinguish between the two distinct layers: The core grid-math layer is called Su, and is made up of “pure” functions that expect normalized values. This is useful if you prefer argument-syntax to shorthand syntax, or if you are building your own Susy mixins. The upper Susy layer provides syntax-sugar – global defaults, shorthand-parsing, normalization, and a smaller set of common-use functions that call on the core math as necessary. This is the primary API for most users."},"PHILOSOPHY.html":{"filename":"PHILOSOPHY.html","title":"Philosophy","contents":"The Susy3 Philosophy We no longer recommend using Susy as a primary layout solution. With the advent of flexbox and the CSS Grid module, there are fewer and fewer reasons to use a grid library like Susy, and that’s wonderful! Grid libraries were always a temporary fix, waiting for the browser to take over. Still, not everyone can play with the latest specs, and there will always be edge-cases that require manual grid-math. Susy3 is trimmed down to the most basic features: a lightweight library of functions that can be used along with float, flexbox, or any other CSS. Susy can be used for on-the-fly grid-math, or used to generate a class-based system – so that your grids are built to spec for the requirements of your team and application. Not For Everyone Much of the power and flexibility in Susy is now available directly in the browser with additional benefits and lower overhead. CSS Grids The CSS Grid module is relatively new, but has gained browser-support quickly – and there is no third-party tool available with the same power and simplicity it provides. Rachel Andrew and Jen Simmons have compiled a comprehensive set of articles, examples, and even copy-paste templates (with fallbacks built in) on their gridbyexample.com site. Flexbox Flexbox also provides intrinsic sizing and relationships, with near-complete support in modern browsers which can help make strict/explicit grids obsolete. Fractions If you need a grid system that works with legacy browsers, I recommend an approach similar to OOCSS. While their code is out of date, the approach is worth adopting to modern practices: Remove gutters (or use padding for gutters) to dramatically simplify the grid math. Use simple fractions to create a robust nested grid. Optionally create class-names as needed. Those techniques can be used with floats, flexbox, display-tables, and more. In Sass it might looks something like this: .span1of2 { width: percentage(1/2); } .span3of12 { width: percentage(3/12); } This is the same technique used by previous versions of Susy when you set gutter-position to inside or inside-static. In order to create a class-based system in Sass, you can run a loop like this one: $columns: 12; [class^='span'] { float: left; } @for $i from 1 through $columns { .span#{$i}of#{$columns} { width: percentage($i / $columns); } } Without ever loading a third-party tool, you can design your own grid system in a few lines of code. Susy as a Fallback Susy3 works similarly to the percentage() technique, but provides support for margin-gutters and (simple) mixed-unit grids: .span1of2 { width: span(1 of 2); margin-right: gutter(of 2); } .span3of12 { width: span(3 of 12); margin: 0 (gutter() / 2); } When the math gets complicated, Susy can be there to step in – but there is no need for Susy if you can keep the math simple. No Mixins The biggest change in Susy3 is that we’ve removed all the mixins. On initial upgrade, most projects will run into errors with missing mixins – container, span, or otherwise. While mixins can provide a nice shortcut for common use-cases, they also make the actual CSS more opaque, and quickly become out-of-date – discouraging incremental improvements to your application. In a world with growing browser support for any number of powerful CSS layout techniques, it would be neglegent of us to push everyone into a single one-size-fits-all solution. There are other frameworks that provide that service, but Susy was never intended to be one of them.

That entire process can be condensed with these two functions. For anyone that wants to access the full power of Susy, and build their own plugins, functions, or mixins – this is the primary API for compiling user input, and accessing the core math. This is the same technique we use internally, to keep our API layer simple and light-weight. Every function accepts two arguments, a “shorthand” description of the span or context, and an optional settings-map to override global defaults. Use susy-compile() to parse, merge, and normalize all the user settings into a single map. Then use su-call() to call one of the core math functions, with whatever data is needed for that function. Examples scss Susy API gutter function @function susy-gutter( $context: susy-get('columns'), $config: () ) { // compile and normalize all user arguments and global settings $context: susy-compile($context, $config, 'context-only'); // call `su-gutter` with the appropriate data @return su-call('su-gutter', $context); } scss Sample span mixin for floated grids @mixin span( $span, $config: () ) { $context: susy-compile($span, $config); width: su-call('su-span', $context); $end: map-get($context, 'span') + map-get($context, 'location') - 1; $is-last: ($end == map-get($context, 'columns')); @if $is-last { float: right; } @else { float: left; margin-right: su-call('su-gutter', $context); } } Related @function susy-compile() @function su-call() @function susy-compile() Susy’s syntax layer has various moving parts, with syntax-parsing for the grid/span shorthand, and normalization for each of the resulting values. The compile function rolls this all together in a single call – for quick access from our internal API functions, or any additional functions and mixins you add to your project. Pass user input and configuration maps to the compiler, and it will hand back a map of values ready for Su. Combine this with the su-call function to quickly parse, normalize, and process grid calculations. Parameters & Return $short: null (list | map) Shorthand expression to define the width of the span, optionally containing: a count, length, or column-list span; at $n, first, or last location on asymmetrical grids; narrow, wide, or wider for optionally spreading across adjacent gutters; of $n <spread> for available grid columns and spread of the container (span counts like of 6 are only valid in the context of symmetrical grids); and set-gutters $n to override global gutter settings $config: null (map) Optional map of Susy grid configuration settings $context-only: false (bool) Allow the parser to ignore span and span-spread values, only parsing context and container-spread @return (map) Parsed and normalized map of settings, based on global and local configuration, alongwith shorthad adjustments. Example scss $user-input: 3 wide of susy-repeat(6, 120px) set-gutters 10px; $grid-data: susy-compile($user-input, $susy); @each $key, $value in $grid-data { /* #{$key}: #{$value}, */ } css compiled /* columns: 120px 120px 120px 120px 120px 120px, */ /* gutters: 10px, */ /* spread: 0, */ /* container-spread: -1, */ /* span: 3, */ Related @function su-call() Requires @function susy-settings() @function susy-normalize() @function susy-parse() Used By @function susy-span() @function susy-gutter() @function susy-slice() @function susy-svg-grid() @function su-call() The Susy parsing and normalization process results in a map of configuration settings, much like the global $susy settings map. In order to pass that information along to Su math functions, the proper values have to be picked out, and converted to arguments. The su-call function streamlines that process, weeding out the unnecessary data, and passing the rest along to Su in the proper format. Combine this with susy-compile to quickly parse, normalize, and process grid calculations. Parameters & Return $name: ('su-span' | 'su-gutter' | 'su-slice') Name of the Su math function to call. $config: (map) Parsed and normalized map of Susy configuration settings to use for math-function arguments. @return (*) Results of the function being called.

The plugin adds svg-grid-colors setting to your global defaults, which you can override in $susy. It also provides you with a new function, susy-svg-grid(), which will return inline svg for use in backgrounds or generated content. This function come with an unprefixed alias by default, using the svg-grid import. If you only only want prefixed versions of the API, import the svg-grid/prefix partial instead. Examples scss importing the plugin // The full path to import Susy will depend on your setup… // unprefixed @import 'plugins/svg-grid'; // prefixed @import 'plugins/svg-grid/prefix'; scss generating background grids .grid { background: susy-svg-grid() no-repeat scroll; } css compiled .grid { background: susy-svg-grid() no-repeat scroll; } @function susy-svg-grid() aliased as svg-grid() Return inline svg-data in to display the grid. Parameters & Return $grid: $susy (Map | List) Map or shorthand defining the current grid $colors: null (Color | List | null) Column color, or list of colors for column-gradient, used to override the global svg-grid-colors setting $offset: null (Length | null) Manually override the default grid-image offset, to account for grid edges @return (String) CSS inline-data SVG string, in url(<svg>) format, for use in image or content properties Example scss .grid { background: susy-svg-grid() no-repeat scroll; } css compiled .grid { background: susy-svg-grid() no-repeat scroll; } Requires @function susy-compile() @function susy-get() @function _susy-svg-gradient() [private] @function _susy-svg-color() [private] @function su-call() @function _susy-svg-offset() [private] @function susy-span() @function _susy-svg-column-position() [private] @function _susy-svg-rect() [private] Used By @function svg-grid()"},"su-math.html":{"filename":"su-math.html","title":"Su: Core Math Engine","contents":"Grid Math Engine The su functions give you direct access to the math layer, without any syntax-sugar like shorthand parsing, and normalization. If you prefer named arguments, and stripped-down syntax, you can use these functions directly in your code – replacing span, gutter, and slice. These functions are also useful for building mixins or other extensions to Susy. Apply the Susy syntax to new mixins and functions, using our “Plugin Helpers”, or write your own syntax and pass the normalized results along to su for compilation. Related @function su-span() @function su-gutter() @function su-slice() @function su-span() Calculates and returns a CSS-ready span width, based on normalized span and context data – a low-level version of susy-span, with all of the logic and none of the syntax sugar. Grids defined with unitless numbers will return % values. Grids defined with comparable units will return a value in the units provided. Grids defined with a mix of units, or a combination of untiless numbers and unit-lengths, will return a calc() string. Parameters & Return $span: (number | list) Number or list of grid columns to span $columns: (list) List of columns available $gutters: (number) Width of a gutter in column-comparable units $spread: (0 | 1 | -1) Number of gutters spanned, relative to span count $container-spread: $spread (0 | 1 | -1) Number of gutters spanned, relative to columns count $location: 1 (integer) Optional position of sub-span among full set of columns @return (length) Relative or static length of a span on the grid Related @function susy-span() Requires @function su-valid-span() @function su-valid-columns() @function su-valid-gutters() @function su-valid-spread() @function su-valid-location() @function su-slice() @function _su-needs-calc-output() [private] @function _su-calc-span() [private] @function _su-sum() [private] Used By @function su-call() @function su-gutter() Calculates and returns a CSS-ready gutter width, based on normalized grid data – a low-level version of susy-gutter, with all of the logic and none of the syntax sugar.
